Dart Data is a fast and space efficient library to deal with data in Dart, Flutter and the web. As of today this mostly includes data structures and algorithms for vectors and matrices, but will soon also include graphs.

This library is open source, stable and well tested. Development happens on [GitHub](http://github.com/renggli/dart-data). Feel free to report issues or create a pull-request there. General questions are best asked on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data+dart).

The package is hosted on [dart packages](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/data). Up-to-date [class documentation](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/data/latest/) is created with every release.
